After making a complete project in C, I was really motivated this semester to work on another project, this time in C++. We made a dummy CPP Application for Taxi and Bike Booking, Book My Ride. This time, as my team focussed on working on the components of the application, I focussed on the Login/SignUp Component and also in cleaning and simplification and maintanenace of same naming conventions wherever possible, to increase efficiency of the program and readabilty of the code. It worked out very well and the End Semester Examiner really liked our project and so did our freinds. It was simple yet worth taking a look. Many of my friends were surprised by the amount of code writtenðŸ˜….

-   Wherever there is a list, serial numbers are used instead of index numbers, hence starting from 1 and not 0.
-   Wherever there is a user Menu, enter 0 to GO BACK and any number from 1 to n to select any of the option.
